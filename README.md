Podcast player!

## status
Non functional, under active development!

## why i am making this
I listen to *alot* of podcasts, and your only real optio:ns for cross platform listening is spotify, youtube, and apple podcasts. This is non ideal, you are locked into their platform, and there is not much felxibility.

You can also use the RSS feed that all podcasts provide, however this has its own issues, most of the time if you listen through rss, you cannot resume mid episode (at least on most desktop applications) and having this sync across devices is not something I have worked out how to do.

This is why my main goals for this is to have a simple set of apps and a library that makes listening to podcasts across many devices easy, I plan on doing this by storing episode progress, and subscribed feeds in simple formats that can be moved to or from other services easily, in the end it would be amazing to have a tui, an android app, and maybe even a desktop gui and ios app.
